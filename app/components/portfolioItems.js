      'Ally Bank wanted to create an iPad-based game for use at the National Auto Dealers Association (NADA) conference. The game was a hit with the attendees and was a great way to engage with the audience and promote the Ally brand. The game combined elements of Sim City with a 3D overview of a Ally World that the player could explore and interact with, and a street-level game like Grand Theft Auto where users could use an ATM, explore a car dealership, take a ride in a taxicab, grab a bite at a cafe, sit in a park, visit Ally Headquarters, and much more.',
